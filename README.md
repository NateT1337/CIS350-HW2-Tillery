## Technical Background
My technical background is fairly broad but not yet too deep. I have studied C programming as well as Java and MatLAB for school, and I have studied a multitude of technical things outside of school.
    * C, C++, C#\
    * MatLAB, R, Python, Java\
    * LabVIEW, JustBASIC, Ladder Logic\
    * Some Unix command propmt stuff from Debian OS\
    * Some networking experience\
Please note that I am not neccesarily fluent or even proficient in any of these. These are languages that I have made a habitual use of now or in the past, and that I believe have contributed to my current knowledge.

I don't know for sure what my 'favorite meme' is, but I presume that we are showing our capability to paste a hyperlink. I hope it will be okay to use a video instead of a picture.
